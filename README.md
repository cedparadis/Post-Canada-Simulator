# Post-Canada-Simulator

Mini system that can simulates delivery of different packages from a start city to a destination. 
It will load package with different tracking numbers and weight where the tracking number will determine what type of package it is.
Moreover, it can unload package at will either with specific tracking number or the whole truck at once.
Also, it can calculate the salary of the driver depending on the number of packages in the cargo.
Finally, the program can track the total weight when we load a package, when we unload all with keeping the weight of the truck in the balance.
